# complex_object_in_wave_flume
The codes solve interactions between wave/current and ship/mangrove/panel.  
1. a ship in a steady current
2. mangrove trees in waves
3. fixed/floating solar panel module  
The geometry of the object obtained by LiDAR scan and a given STL file should be compared before putting it to the numerical flume.
