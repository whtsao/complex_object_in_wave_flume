# complex_object_in_wave_flume
The codes solve interactions between wave/current and ship/mangrove/panel.
1. ship = a ship in a steady current. STL of a ship model is input
2. mangrove trees in waves = Waves propagate through a real mangrove tree. STL of a mangrove tree is input.
3. floating panel 2D = 2D simulation of multiple floating solar panels in waves. The panels are linked and moored.
4. floating panel 3D = 3D simulation of multiple floating solar panels in waves. The panels are linked and moored.
5. wind panel 3d = 3D simulations of single panel or panel array in winds. The panel is given by seld-defined SDF.
    
p.s. The geometry of the object obtained by LiDAR scan and a given STL file should be compared before putting it to the numerical flume.
