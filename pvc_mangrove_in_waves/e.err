[mike077:mpi_rank_820][mv2_print_wc_status_error] IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR: This event is generated when a sender is unable to receive feedback from the receiver. This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.

This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.

This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.

This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages.

[mike015:mpi_rank_415][mv2_print_wc_status_error] IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR: This event is generated when a sender is unable to receive feedback from the receiver. This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.

This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.

[mike013:mpi_rank_256][mv2_print_wc_status_error] IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR: This event is generated when a sender is unable to receive feedback from the receiver. This means that either the receiver just never ACKs sender messages in a specified time period, or it has been disconnected or it is in a bad state which prevents it from responding. If this happens when sending the first message, usually it means that the QP connection attributes are wrong or the remote side is not in a state that it can respond to messages. If this happens after sending the first message, usually it means that the remote QP is not available anymore or that there is congestion in the network preventing the packets from reaching on time.
