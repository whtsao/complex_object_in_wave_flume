/project/cekees/cekees/proteus/fct/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools/config/__init__.py:28: SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: As setuptools moves its configuration towards `pyproject.toml`,
`setuptools.config.parse_configuration` became deprecated.

For the time being, you can use the `setuptools.config.setupcfg` module
to access a backward compatible API, but this module is provisional
and might be removed in the future.
